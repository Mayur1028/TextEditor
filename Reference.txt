Project Structure ->

app/ : This directory contains the main application logic and GUI code. The main.py file can be the entry point for your
application. gui.py will include all the code related to the Tkinter GUI, and ml_integration.py will include code for
integrating machine learning.

models/ : Store your machine learning model definition and training logic in ml_model.py. If your ML model is complex,
you may want to further organize this directory.

data/ : This directory can contain sample data for testing and development. It might also be the place to store user 
data or files that the user opens and edits in your WordPad.

utils/ : Utility functions, such as file handling or any other general-purpose functions, can be placed here. For example,
you might have a file_handling.py module to handle reading and writing files.

requirements.txt: List all the project dependencies here. This file can be used with tools like pip to install the required
packages.

Remember to modularize your code, keeping the GUI, ML, and utility functions separate for better readability and
maintainability. Also, consider using version control (e.g., Git) to track changes and collaborate with others.


ML Functionalities ->

1. Auto-Summarization:
Use natural language processing techniques to automatically generate a summary of the entered text. This can be
helpful for users dealing with large documents.

2. Spell Checking and Correction:
Implement a spell-checking feature using ML algorithms. Suggest corrections for misspelled words as the user types.

3. Language Translation:
Implement a language translation feature that allows the user to translate the entered text into different languages.

4. Autocomplete Suggestions:
Provide autocomplete suggestions for words or phrases as the user types. This can improve typing speed 
and accuracy.

5. Keyword Extraction:
Extract and display key terms or keywords from the entered text, helping the user identify the main topics.

6. Text Similarity Comparison:
Compare the similarity between two pieces of text. This can be useful for finding similar content or detecting plagiarism.

7. Speech-to-Text and Text-to-Speech:
Integrate speech recognition to convert spoken words into text and vice versa. This can be useful for users who prefer 
speech input or output.

8. Style and Tone Analysis:
Analyze the writing style and tone of the text, providing feedback on whether it's formal, informal, persuasive, etc.
